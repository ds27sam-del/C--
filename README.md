# 📘 C++ Mini Projects Menu

This repository contains a **menu-driven C++ program** that demonstrates multiple beginner-friendly projects such as printing arrays, calculating factorials, swapping values, and drawing star patterns.  
The program uses a `switch` statement to let the user choose which project to run individually.

## ✨ Features

The program includes the following functions:

1. **Hello World** – Prints a simple greeting.
2. **Address** – Displays a sample address.
3. **Resume** – Prints a formatted resume.
4. **1D Array** – Prints elements of a one-dimensional array.
5. **2D Array** – Prints elements of a two-dimensional array.
6. **Sum of Two Numbers** – Adds two user-input numbers.
7. **Factorial** – Calculates the factorial of a number.
8. **Percentage** – Computes percentage from 7 subjects.
9. **Swap Values** – Swaps two numbers using a temporary variable.
10. **Arithmetic Operations** – Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
11. **Right-Angle Triangle** – Prints a right-angled triangle using `*`.
12. **Star Shape** – Prints a five-pointed star pattern using `*`.

## 🛠️ How It Works

- The program shows a **menu** with numbered options.
- The user enters a choice (1–12).
- The corresponding function executes.
- The menu repeats until the user enters `0` (Exit).
